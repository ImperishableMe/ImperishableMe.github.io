        <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
        <p>
          <b> xv6 Kernel Programming </b>| C, Unix, File System, OS Feb. 2023
        </p>
        <li>
          Increased the maximum supported file size from 268KB to 64MB by
          introducing a doubly-indirect block number in the file inode
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced the kernel by implementing copy-on-write (COW) support,
          optimizing the efficiency of the fork system call and significantly
          improving the speed of process creation
        </li>

        <li>
          Developed lazy-allocation support for user space heap memory, reducing
          the amortized cost of large heap allocations and enhancing overall
          performance
        </li>

        <li>
          Implemented a new system call pgaccess to expose page access
          information, enabling programs like garbage collectors to make
          intelligent decisions
        </li>

        <p><b> Distributed Systems </b> | Go, Raft, MapReduce March 2022</p>
        <li>
          Implemented a map-reduce system for the distributed word counting
          problem
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented a non-byzantine fault-tolerant distributed consensus
          algorithm named Raft in Go
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented a strongly consistent, partition-tolerant
          distributed key-value system on top of Raft consensus protocol that
          supports log compaction
        </li>
        <li>
          Applied structured logging to debug in a distributed environment and
          used Go concurrency privileges such as goroutines, channels, condition
          variables
        </li>

        <p>
          <b> University Institutional Information System </b> | NodeJS,
          Express, MongoDB, VueJS July 2021
        </p>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented a role based access control system with fine
          granularity

        <p><b>Pocwha OJ </b> | Python, Django, Bootstrap April 2019</p>

        <li>
          Added the functionality of adding new problems to the existing
          collection
        </li>

        <li>
          Designed and implemented a feature to run the user submissions in a
          resource (time, memory) limited execution environment and upon
          completion of execution, report resource consumption back to the user
        </li>

        <li>
          Decoupled user-submitted code execution from the request-response
          cycle using an asynchronous task queue to minimize response time
