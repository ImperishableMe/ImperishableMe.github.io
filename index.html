            customers
          </li>
          <li>
            Identified and resolved a critical performance bottleneck in a

            benchmark results
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and implemented pull-based consumer support on top of an
            existing push-based pub-sub architecture in an open-source message
            broker in Go enabling the consumers to sustain even on event burst
            of size 20k events/s
          </li>
          <li>
            Replaced a synchronous pipeline with a pub/sub event bus based
            asynchronous one that improves the service availability by over 20%

        <p>
          <b> xv6 Kernel Programming |C, Unix, File System, OS Feb. 2023 </b>
        </p>
        <li>
          Increased the maximum supported file size from 268KB to 64MB by
          introducing a doubly-indirect block number in the file inode
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced the kernel by implementing copy-on-write (COW) support,
          optimizing the efficiency of the fork system call and significantly
          improving the speed of process creation •Developed lazy-allocation
          support for user space heap memory, reducing the amortized cost of
          large heap allocations and enhancing overall performance
        </li>

        <li>
          Implemented a new system call pgaccess to expose page access
          information, enabling programs like garbage collectors to make
          intelligent decisions
        </li>

        <p><b> Distributed Systems |Go, Raft, MapReduce March 2022 </b></p>
        <li>
          Implemented a map-reduce system for the distributed word counting
          problem
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented a non-byzantine fault-tolerant distributed consensus
          algorithm named Raft in Go
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented a strongly consistent, partition-tolerant
          distributed key-value system on top of Raft consensus protocol that
          supports log compaction
        </li>
        <li>
          Applied structured logging to debug in a distributed environment and
          used Go concurrency privileges such as goroutines, channels, condition
          variables
        </li>

          collection
        </li>

        <li>
          Designed and implemented a feature to run the user submissions in a
          resource (time, memory) limited execution environment and upon
          completion of execution, report resource consumption back to the user
        </li>

        <li>
          Decoupled user-submitted code execution from the request-response
          cycle using an asynchronous task queue to minimize response time
